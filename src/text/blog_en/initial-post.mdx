I started this website as a place to try new things. I'm not the best writer but I've learned some things on the way that I want to share. Also, my memory sucks and some of the projects I've done I no longer understand. I have no idea how I did it and like all good coders I wrote no comments. My plan is that from now on there's at least one post for each project I make. So in the future, I can come back and trash it for how bad it's written.

Since I'm new to all this expect nothing. I don't have any particular topic to talk about. I guess I'm going to write about coding. But I did a bachelor in physics so from time to time I may post something related to science. I also like to travel so, maybe I'll write about it? Only future me knows.

I only hope that someone reads one of these posts and uses it for its projects, or for inspiration, or to steal it. I know I've done it with other people's blogs. If you're a coder I know you have too.

I wrote this particular post because I've seen other people do it. Other people put their goals and objectives for the things they want to accomplish. I don't think this is a high school lab report. I have free time and this is more productive than just watching Netflix or playing Overwatch (another writing topic?).

Anyway, I hope you can use some of my writing or that at least amuses you.
