# Dario Zubillaga Martín

I am Mexican by birth and Spaniard by heritage. I studied physics in the **Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)**. I did my [thesis](http://132.248.67.65/F/?func=find-b&local_base=TES01&find_code=WRD&request=acrecion+de+campo+fantasma&adjacent=N) on numerical relativity with _Miguel Alcubierre_ 	in 2012. Then I did a master's in computer science in the IIMAS of UNAM. I worked with self-organizing traffic lights with _Carlos Gershenson_ and graduated with a published [article](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/16/5/2384) in 2014.

I've always worked as a **software developer**. I've done consulting, web applications, multimedia projects, mobile apps, videogames, and data analysis. I am a software enthusiast and I am interested in all the applications you can build with it. Nowadays I am focused on web applications because I think they have more impact in society.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the mountains and caves. I have been going to caves for ten years and I have been SCUBA diving whenever I can for the last four.
