I started this website as a place to try new things. I'm not the best writer but I've learned some things on the way that I want to share. Also, my memory is not the best and some of the projects I've done I no longer understand. Like all good developers there's a lack of documentation. My plan is that from now on there's at least one post for each project I make. That way, in the future I can come back and trash it for how bad it's written.

English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistake in the text. Doubts? Comments? Jokes? Insults? Write me an [email](mailto:dariozubi@gmail.com).
