## Who am I?

I was born in Mexico City in 1987. I lived there until 2017 and then moved to Playa del Carmen, where I'm living now. My father is mexican and my mother is venezuelan with a spanish heritage. I have both mexican and spanish passports.

I studied physics in the **Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)**. I did my [thesis](http://132.248.67.65/F/?func=find-b&local_base=TES01&find_code=WRD&request=acrecion+de+campo+fantasma&adjacent=N) on numerical relativity with _Miguel Alcubierre_ 	in 2012. Then I did a masters in computer science in the **Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Avanzadas y Sistemas (IIMAS)** of UNAM. I worked with self-organizing traffic lights with _Carlos Gershenson_ and graduated with a published [article](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/16/5/2384) in 2014.

## What do I do?

I've always worked as a **software developer**. I've done consulting, web applications, multimedia proyects, mobile apps and videogames. I'm currently working in the design of user interfaces for medical systems in the US.

In my free time I like outdoors. I was part of the Mountaineering Association of UNAM from 2010 to 2017. I did mostly spelunking but also enjoyed rock climbing and trekking. In 2016 I started SCUBA diving and in 2019 I got my cave diving certification.
